// code editor (here vs code): it is a kind of notebook where we can write our program or code and it also helps to write the code, that is, it helps with the syntax etc.
// compiler (here gcc for c language): it is a kind of software where the rules or instructions of a programming language are written and it also helps to run the code.
// 1. code likha code editor pe, 2. compiler check karega code sahi hai ya nahi, 3. sahi hai toh run karega, galat hai toh error throw karega.

// file extension such as .c, .txt, .py, .java, .cpp etc tells about the content in the file, here file1.c tells that I have created a file in which I have written the content or code in C language.
// commands at terminal: 1. gcc file1.c -> here we are invoking the gcc compiler to compile the program written in file1, 2. ".\a.exe" (an executable file is created by the system after compilation) to run the program on windows and "./a.out" for mac os or linux.
